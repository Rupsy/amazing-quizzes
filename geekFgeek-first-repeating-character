Problem Link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-first-repeated-character-in-a-string/
Description : Given a string, find the first repeated character in it. We need to find the character 
that occurs more than once and whose index of second occurrence is smallest. A variation of this question is discussed here.

Solution: 

vowel_letters = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
vowel_letters.add('a')

input = "Ravi had been saying that he had been there"

inp_list = []

inp_arr = input.split(" ")
for i in inp_arr:

    if inp_list.__contains__(i ):
        print("First repeated " , i)
    else:
        inp_list.append(i)

from collections import OrderedDict
dict = OrderedDict()
str = "geeksforgeeks"
cnt=0
for ch in str:
    if dict.__contains__(ch):
        dict[ch] = dict.get(ch) + 1
    else:
        dict.update({ch : 1})

for k , v in dict.items():
    if v ==1:
        cnt = cnt + 1
        if cnt == 3:
            print(k)
            break
