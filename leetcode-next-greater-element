Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]

Solution: 

nums1 = [4,1,2]
nums2 = [1,3,4,2]

hashmap = {}
ans = []
for i in range (len(nums1) ) :
    for j in range(len(nums2)  ):
        if nums1[i] == nums2[j]:
            hashmap[nums1[i]] = j


ans_arr = []
for key , val in hashmap.items():
    key_ans = -1
    for j in range ( val +1 , len(nums2) ):

        if nums2[j] > key:
            key_ans = nums2[j]
            break
    ans_arr.append(key_ans)

print(   ans_arr)
