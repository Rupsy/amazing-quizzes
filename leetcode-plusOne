Example : Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Solution : 
input = [9,9,9]

l = len(input)
sum = ""
ans_arr = []
for i in range(l):
    print(input[i])
    sum = sum + str(input[i])

a = int(sum) +1
sum = str(a)
for i in sum:
    ans_arr.append(i)
print (ans_arr)
