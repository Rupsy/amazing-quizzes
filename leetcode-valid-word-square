Given a sequence of words, check whether it forms a valid word square.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

Note: The number of words given is at least 1 and does not exceed 500. Word length will be at least 1
and does not exceed 500. Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z. Example 1:

Input:
[
  "abcd",
  "bnrt",
  "crmy",
  "dtye"
]

Solution: 

words = [
    "abcd",
    "bnrt",
    "crmy",
    "dtye"
]

for i in range(len(words) ):
    horiz = words[i]
    ver = ""
    isvalid = True
    for j in range (len(words[i]) ):
        ver = ver + words[i][j]
    print (ver)
    if ver != horiz:
        isvalid = False
print ("isvalid" , isvalid)
